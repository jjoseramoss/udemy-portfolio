<h1>The Best Movies According to Jose</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>ROCKY</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie series because everytime that I watch the movies I get motivated, and it 
    reminds me of watching movies with my father which I enjoy greatly.
</p>

<h3>INTERSTELLAR</h3>
<p>Another Great Movie Choice, as this movie has INSANE visuals and great action as well as beautiful scenery, This movie greatly inspired me to 
    want to become a space engineer. Hopefully I get to go into that career.
</p>
<h3>IRON CLAW</h3>
<p>This movie is just crazy, the insane amount of plot twists and action as well as drama just all ties in together and 
    the acting is great, I was extremely engaged and it was a great memory as I was watching the movie with my family.
